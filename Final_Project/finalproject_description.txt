This doccument summarizes the project functionalities and implementations, what the included classes do, and any unexpected challenges.

Multiple GUI systems - Qiaochu
Class objects with animation hierarchies - Minghan and Eleanor
Data input/output - Qiaochu
Sound - Qiaochu
Code interactions and program running - Together

Aircraft - This class has an animation hierarchy (Eleanor) that allows the wings to flap while the aircraft moves.
         - (Minghan) This class disply the special visualization of an angel-like aircraft and can be moved by keyCode "up" "down" "left" and "right". After being shot by enemy bullets, the aircraft will glint for showing it is hitted.
Bullet - (Minghan) This class has 6 different visualizations for 4 shooting modes, 1 boom and 1 enemy bullet. The bullet either comes from aircraft or from enemy invaders. 
Button -
Coin (Eleanor)- This class is just a display function with an ellipse and a function called 'collected' which determines if the airplane is within it's area which would mean the coin was collected. In the main file, when an enemy is shot and killed it generates 1-6 coins. The height and width of the invader are taken as imput and the x, y cordinates are generated randomly within two width and height distances for the invader's center.
display_life - 
Invader (Eleanor)- This class takes x, y, hieght, and width floats to determine the dimensions and position of the invader. It takes a float for y velocity, which makes the invader fall, and an int for resistance which determines how many times the invader must be shot to die. It keeps track of whether the invader has generated coins, been killed and/or wiped out by the bomb, and landed on the ground. It accelerates slightly as it falls and may randomly move sideways or in the x direction. It also has a collision function called shotornot, that determines if the invader has been shot by bullets. There is a variation on it for one of the types of bullets.

Challenges: 1. Tons of interaction and each bullet should be monitored individually.
Solution: Use Arraylist of bullet class and Array of ArrayList of bullet class, which enables every bullet be called indivisually thorugh loops. 
2. Too much bullets brought burden to the memory.
Solution: Add condition checkings to remove all bullets that are out of screen.
3. It took too long to load music
Solution:
4. Game might be difficult
Solution: Add a god mode which enables aircraft to continuously shooting all kinds of bullets, by pressing 'g'.
