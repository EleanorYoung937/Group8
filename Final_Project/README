D. The player shoots the enemies, which may need to be shot 1-3 times to be killed.
E. When the enemy is killed, it generates coins.
F. The player collects the coins to generate a higher score. Every 15 coins, up to 45, they earn a new type of bullet.
G. For each enemy that lands on the ground the player loses a point from their score.
H. The player can press 'b' for a one-time bomb that clears the screen of all invaders.
I. For grading purposes, pressing 'g' makes the player go into God mode, constantly shooting all forms of bullets. This and the bomb will make it much easier to win so the grader can see our whole game.
