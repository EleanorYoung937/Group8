This animation depicts a fall night scene. In the background, the sky will be dark blue and the grass will be dark green. During the animation, the moon will rise and birds will fly across the canvas. In the meanwhile, leaves are seen falling off of the tree and the fish will swim as the river flows. 

The classes used to create the animation are as follows:

1. Moon (Qiaochu Li) - the moon is depicted by a simple yellow ellipse with changing values in the vertical direction. Upon reaching the top of the canvas, it will jump back and loop through the animation.

2. Birds (Qiaochu Li) - the bird shape is create using PShape. It moves up and down while crossing the canvas to echo how birds move in real life. This is accomplished by changing the x value of the shape while utilizing cosine waves in the y value. Since it is the night, birds are made to be black to depict its shadowy figure.
