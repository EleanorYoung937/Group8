The display_life class is written by Qiaochu. This class generates a rectangle to display remaining lives and another rectangle to display the progress of the game. With each invader shot, the bar will turn red by 10% so that after 10 invaders being killed, the bar should be completely red. 
The Lives class will create an object for each life that the player has with a total of 3. The lives will be indicated by 3 red circles, each time an invader lands, the player will lose a life.
The invaders class written by Eleanor that creates an object that falls from the top and attempts to land on the bottom. They are killed by bullets and wiped from existence by the one-time bomb (although they donâ€™t count toward the kill count). They are called in intervals and have dimensions, velocity, and movements that are determined by random functions.
